currently downloading shared videos [slow - many - 4063?4? divisible by 2]

downloaded: shared and modified docs, audio, videos

ffmpeg -i demo.mov -vcodec h264 -acodec aac -strict 2 demo.mp4
ffmpeg -i demo.mov -vcodec h264 -acodec aac -strict 2 -crf 24 demo.mp4

-vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" may fix 4064 -- might need to delete (0 byte?) mp4 file though.

education tab
continue processing share/modify.json
more filetypes etc.
